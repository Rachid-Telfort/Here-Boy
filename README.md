My team's submition for the 2019 Global Game Jam

This game was created as a collaboration project for Playcrafting's 2019 Global Game Jam.

The purpose of the game is to find the dog in the level. 
Once the player finds the dog, they have to push the dog towards the house and they win!
The game is from a first person perspective and controls are as follows:

Press W or the up arrow key to move the character up.
Press A or the left arrow key to move the character left.
Press S or the down arrow key to move the character down.
Press D or the right arrow key to move the character right.

This game was my first time working in 3D and I learned alot! 
Hopefully my fellow coders can find this useful!
